# Stock Analysis
By Abbey Reese
## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to conceptualize one technical deliverable and a written report to deliver results based on a stock analysis of a clientâ€™s parents. He wanted to expand his dataset over the last few years to the entire stock market to determine if they (his parents) were making an educated investment. During this analysis, refactored code was utilized to loop through all the data at one time. Afterwards, one can determine whether refactoring code was successfully made to make the VBA script run faster compared to previous findings. A written analysis explaining findings was then utilized to determine that(if?) the right choices were made.
